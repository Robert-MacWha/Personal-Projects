### Elementary Particle Simulation
<img align="right" width="30%" src="../Java\_Processing\NEAT\Visualization.PNG"></img>
A basic particle simulation I created that attempts to emulate electro-magnetic interactions between elementary particles.  Keeping in mind that this was made with no correct equations, I find that the dots moving around look pretty. 

### Visual NEAT Implementation
A implementation of the NEAT Algorithm I wastefully coded after making one in pure Java.  This was created so I could visually see what the networks looked like, hence, most of the time was spent on building the graph renderer. 

### 3D Grapher
A simple processing script that generates 3D graphs of arbitrary equations.  I recommend adding peasyCam to this project (can just be dropped in) if you prefer perspectives other than top-down.

### Water Particle Simulator

A particle simulation that attempts to create a fluid that reacts in a similar way water.  Through emergent mechanics this fluid can react to waves, hold surface tension, and generally look cool.

### NEAT Implementation
An implementation of the NEAT algorithm written in pure java. A precursor to my [Visual NEAT Implementation](#visual-neat-implementation) and to my [NEAT Racecar Project](#neat-racecar).

### NEAT Racecars

A large-scale project I created as a final project for my Grade 11 ITGS class.  This project contains a fully-functional map editor with only minor glitches and a NEAT environment where agents train to race around your custom track.
