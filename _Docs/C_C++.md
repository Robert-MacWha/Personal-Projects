### Flowing Lights
A simple project created to help me learn about interacting with Arduinos and individual pins.  This project enables and disables pins in such a way that attached LEDs will appear to smoothly flow in a line.

### Simple 8-Bit Counter
<img align="right" width="25%" src="../C_C++\C\Simple_8-bit_Binary_Counter\Project.jpg"></img>
A 8-bit counter that displays the current count through attached LEDs. Interestingly, by removing the delay and changing the number of bits being counted you can get a feel for the clock speed of the arduino.

### Gyroscope SDA/SCL Communication Test
Playing around with SDA/SCL communications across the Arduino's data pins. This specific script communicates with an GY-521 gyroscopic accelerometer.

### Ultrasonic Sensor Test
Playing around with reading data from an ultrasonic sensor (used to sense distance).  Originally this was going to be used in the creation of a self-driving car but that project has been indefinitely put on hold.

### OOP Intro
A project following an introductory OOP course that covered creating basic classes.

### OOP Fundamentals
A project following an introductory OOP course that covered Header files and more complex classes.

### OOP Advanced
A project following an introductory OOP course that covered even more complex class functions and passing objects as function parameters / returning objects from functions.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism
A project following an introductory OOP course that covered class inheritance and polymorphism.

### Learning SDL
A project attempting to understand how to use C++'s SDL library to create a window and populate it with pixels.  This project technically works, however there is a limitation where the program doesn't work when trying to render more than a specific number of pixels.

### Deck of Cards
A small-scale project on creating a functional deck of cards that can be initialized, shuffled, and dealt. A precursor to my [War Project](#war-game).

### War Game
A medium-scale project on creating a functional game of war played over the terminal.

### School Database
A medium-scale project on creating a functional mock database for a school that contains functionality for teachers, students, and classes.  A precursor to my [Airline Database Project](#airline-database).

### :star: Airline Database
<img align="left" width="30%" src="../C_C++\C++\Airline Database\Documentation.PNG"></img>
A large-scale project on creating a functional mock airline database with documentation.  This was created as a final project for my Grade 12 ITGS course.  Documentation is included inside of the project files and a website was also created that details the more minute details, currently hosted [here](https://robert-macwha.github.io/Extra/ITGS%20Documentation/index.html).
